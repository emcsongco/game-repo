ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project puts what I have learned by designing and building a functioning browser-based game using HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript.

TIC-TAC-TOE is a game with two players marking a 3x3 grid each turn with an X and O. The game is won when tiles have 3 tokens that are the same in consecutive rows, columns or diagonals.  Game ends when all tiles are filled.

In this version of the TIC-TAC-TOE, player X places a starfish token while play O places a sand dollar token in place of the usual X's and O's.

BUILT WITH

HTML
CSS/SCSS
JAVASCRIPT


GETTING STARTED
The game lets you play right away with the first move always assigned to X as a default. Play by yourself with alternating X's and O's placed on the board until a winner emerges in each and every turn or the game ends when all tiles are filled with no winning positions filled.
